A man wearing lederhose entered a biergarten located in Berlin, Germany.
The man entered the biergarten and asked one of the waitress if they had seen his giant hund run through grass.
There were vendors selling gebaeck and bratwurst along with weissbier.
Distracted by the smell of Gebaeck and Bratwurst, the man almost forgot about his Hund sprinting through the Biergarten.
That is when a woman in a nice dirndel told the man that his hund took off towards Hauptstrasse.
Taking a brief pause to place her drinks, the waitress, clad in a deep blue dirndel turned to him, "A hund? I'm not too sure I have. You may have better luck with one of the stall owners on the hauptstrasse."The man scurried his way to hauptstrasse, where he came across a wettbewerbsfaehig rammstein parading their way through town.
