A man wearing lederhose entered a biergarten located in Berlin, Germany.
The man entered the biergarten and asked one of the waitress if they had seen his giant hund run through grass.
There were vendors selling gebaeck and bratwurst along with weissbier.
Taking a brief pause to place her drinks, the waitress, clad in a deep blue dirndel turned to him, "A hund? I'm not too sure I have. You may have better luck with one of the stall owners on the hauptstrasse."
